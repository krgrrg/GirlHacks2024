                    <h2>Disco is a genre of dance music that emerged in the early 1970s, gaining widespread popularity throughout the decade and peaking in the late '70s before experiencing a decline in the early 1980s. Known for its infectious rhythms, lush production, and heavy use of orchestration, disco became synonymous with nightlife, dance clubs, and a vibrant cultural movement that celebrated freedom of expression and diversity.</h2>
